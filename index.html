            <div class="text">
                <p>I am currently studying towards a Bachelors Degree of Neuroscience	and Behavior Biology at Emory University. With a strong interest in unraveling the complexities of the human brain and its functions, my past experiences focus on the relationships between technology, cognitive thinking and healthcare service. 

                  While attending full time high school in Seattle Washington, I worked alongside researchers at the University of Washington decoding the relationship between pain management and conscious distraction. 
                  
                  Beyond research and code, I thrive in collaborative enviornments. With leadership involvements in my local communities of school and faith, my group work brings a pride in fostering change.  
                  
                  While my journey is in its early stages, I am committed to continuous learning and am enthusiastic about the potential of technology to make a significant impact in the realms of neuroscience and medicine.
